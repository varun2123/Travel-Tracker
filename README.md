## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used to create robust APIs and web applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system used to store user data and information about visited countries.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language used to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **HTML**: Hypertext Markup Language used for creating the structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets used for styling the HTML elements.
- **Rest API**: Use of Post, Get etc routes.

3. **Set Up PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already: [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - Create a new database named `world_capitals`.
   - Modify the `pg.Client` configuration in `app.js` to match your PostgreSQL setup (e.g., username, password, host, port) or you can make changes in the code to match your existing configuration.
   - Import the csv files and create tables according to them.

4. **Run the Application**: 
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: 
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the travel tracker application.

## Usage

- Upon accessing the application, you will see a world map with countries highlighted in default colors.
- Each user is assigned a specific color.
- As a user adds countries they have visited, the color of those countries on the map changes to match the user's assigned color.
- You can add a new country you have visited by typing its name in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- You can switch between users.
- To add a new user, click on the "New User" button, fill in the details, and click "Create User".
